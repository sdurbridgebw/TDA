## Time-Domain Acoustics

This is a time domain acoustics solver for simulating sound wave propagation in air.
You can use it to generate impulse responses, or prototype all kinds of funky algorithms. 

This software is available with no guarantee and all that jazz. 
You may not use any of the code in this project for any commercial work without discussing it with me first. 
If you are using this work to perform academic work, please share the love and reference this as a source.
